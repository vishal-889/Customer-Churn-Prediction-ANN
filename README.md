# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ANN
Introduction
Hello, in this project we will briefly discuss about the customer churn prediction model that we will build using the artificial neural network.

Problem Statement
What is customer churn?
So, customer churn is simply the rate at which customers leave doing business with an entity. Simply put, churn prediction involves determining the possibility of customers stopping doing business with an entity. In other words, if a consumer has purchased a subscription to a particular service, we must determine the likelihood that the customer would leave or cancel the membership.

It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Customer churn measures how and why are customers leaving the business.

There are many ways to calculate the customer churn one of the ways is to divide the number of customers leaving a business in a given time interval by the number of customers that are present at the beginning of the period.

We know that customer churn is important in business problems, the ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it.

Clarify for your better understanding let’s take an example, suppose you have taken a premium subscription of the company product now you think that it’s time to leave the subscription, for this you will contact to the company, the company will try to offer some extra functionalities for not leaving the subscription. This is because it will be a loss for any industry that there is some percent of customers are not using their product.

For prediction of this kind of situation, we will do in depth analysis and use some data science techniques, that will predict the customer churn based on several features.
